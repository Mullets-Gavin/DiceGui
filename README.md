Dice Gui let's you skip the player dependency on loading PlayerGui and you can still keep your UI in StarterGui. Require this on both the server & client and run it by simply running `DiceGui:Initialize()` after the require. Make sure this is before any `WaitForChildren()` on UI is called so the script doesn't halt.
